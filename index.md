# About

Hi, I am Patty. Iâ€™m actively seeking job opportunities.

I have 6 years of experience working in software development. My experience expands on full stack web development using Ruby, Javascript and backend system development using Java. I am enthusiastic about diving into new technologies and building software systems. I like to solve problems through organized and elegant code.

I had a career gap to focus on taking care of my baby and family. Now I am ready and excited to resume my career in the software development field that I am deeply passionate about. I am looking for a role where I can apply my expertise and pursue long-term professional growth.
