<h1 id="about" class="anchor">About</h1>

HiðŸ‘‹, I am Patty. Iâ€™m actively seeking job opportunities.

I have 6 years of experience working in software development. My experience expands on full stack web development using Ruby, Javascript and backend system development using Java. I am enthusiastic about diving into new technologies and building software systems. I like to solve problems through organized and elegant code.

I had a career gap to focus on taking care of my baby and family. Now I am ready and excited to resume my career in the software development field that I am deeply passionate about. I am looking for a role where I can apply my expertise and pursue long-term professional growth.

- Implemented `RESTful API` and `microservices` for machine learning systems.

<dt>Front-end</dt>
- Created intuitive user interfaces using front-end technologies such as `HTML`, `Javascript`, `CSS` and `Sass`.

Working at the start-up, I had the opportunity to immerse myself in various aspects of technology. I enjoyed the efficiency and challenging nature of working in a fast-paced working environment. I also enjoyed working closely with client-facing colleagues to deliver features that highly aligned with clients' needs.

Taipei, Taiwan | [Garmin](https://www.garmin.com/) \
`#C #EmbeddedSystem #Git`

The first job after I graduated was to develop system software of consumer electronic products at Garmin. It was an incredible experience to participate and see how the electronic products are manufactured. But soon after, an alumni from my lab offered me an opportunity to work at NetBase Solutions, where I can apply the NLP expertise I acquired during graduate school. I made the decision to seize this new opportunity.
