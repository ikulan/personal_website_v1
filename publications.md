In this research, we present an approach that utilizes lexical patterns to bias the search engine
towards retrieving snippets containing the definitions of the given term. We use Wikipedia as training
data to build a definition classifier without human annotated training data. The retrieved results may contain several senses of the given term. Therefore, we employ hierarchical clustering algorithms to cluster the definition candidates by their meanings.
